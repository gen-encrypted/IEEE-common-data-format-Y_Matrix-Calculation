# IEEE-common-data-format-Y_Matrix-Calculation
A matlab project that can calculate "Y_Bus Admitance Matrix"  for power flow analysis that can read data from IEEE common data format. It can calculate bus matrixes up to 150x150 with ease. It was a part of "Electrical Energy Transmission and Distribution" course project. It uses Ï€ model for transmission lines. The program is designed to read IEEE bus data from a text file and return Y bus admitance matrix as an array.
